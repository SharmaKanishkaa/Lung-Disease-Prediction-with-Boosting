## üìä **Workflow**  

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Visualized distributions of patient features like `Age`, `Gender`, `Air Pollution`, and `Chronic Lung Disease`.  
   - Analyzed the correlation between health and environmental factors with the `Level` (lung disease severity).  

2. **Modeling:**  
   - Implemented three machine learning algorithms to predict lung disease severity:  
     - **XGBoost**  
     - **AdaBoost**  
     - **Random Forest (RF)**  

3. **Performance Metrics:**  
   - Evaluated models using **accuracy scores** to compare their effectiveness.
